RosettaCode Data Project
========================

This git repository contains (almost) all of the code samples available on
http://rosettacode.org organized by Language and Task.


## Getting the Data

All of the data is in this repository, so you can just run:

    git clone https://github.com/acmeism/RosettaCodeData

*However...*

It's a lot of data!

If you just want the latest data, the quickest thing to do is:

    git clone https://github.com/acmeism/RosettaCodeData --single-branch --depth=1


## Tools

This repository's data content is created by a Perl program called
`rosettacode`.

You can install it with this command:

    cpanm RosettaCode

You can rebuild the data with:

    make build


This repository has a `bin` directory with various tools for working with the

## OpenCog: AI/AGI Evaluation Framework

The `opencog` directory contains a post-polyglot transcendent evaluation framework
that analyzes all programming languages for AI and AGI capabilities. OpenCog
represents the culmination of evaluating every known programming language against
the full spectrum of AI capabilities.

### OpenCog Multi-Agent Reasoning System

OpenCog now includes a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration workbench for
solving LLM reasoning tasks, featuring:

- **Agent-Zero**: Master builder that orchestrates cognitive architectures
- **Pattern Language Library**: 10 foundational cognitive patterns for AGI
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Collaborative problem-solving with specialized agents
- **Strategy Repository**: 7 core reasoning strategies
- **95 Reasoning Tasks**: Comprehensive collection of LLM reasoning challenges

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Run the reasoning task demo
python3 opencog/opencog_reasoning_demo.py

# Analyze reasoning tasks
opencog/bin/opencog-reasoning

# Solve a specific task with Agent-Zero
opencog/bin/opencog-agent-zero analogical-problem-solving autonomous
```

### OpenCog Tools

The OpenCog framework provides tools to evaluate languages across AI domains:

* `opencog/bin/opencog-analyze`

    Analyze all languages and generate comprehensive AI capability reports
    showing which languages excel at different AI/cognitive tasks

* `opencog/bin/opencog-hypergraph`

    **NEW**: Refined task specialization analyzer with subcategory-level analysis
    and hypergraph generation revealing patterns of peak performance by
    language and paradigm (45 subcategories across 9 paradigms)

* `opencog/bin/opencog-atom-types`

    **NEW**: Generates formalized atom type expressions for cognitive domains and
    language paradigms. Provides mathematical framework with algebraic operations
    for reasoning about language-domain affinities and paradigm composition.

* `opencog/bin/opencog-reasoning`

    Analyze reasoning tasks and get pattern/strategy recommendations

* `opencog/bin/opencog-agent-zero <task_id> [mode]`

    Orchestrate a reasoning task using Agent-Zero with autonomous,
    collaborative, or guided modes

* `opencog/bin/opencog-manifest`

    Generate the FrankenCog Integration Manifest - identifies the optimal
    language for each AI function to create a "patchwork" of best implementations

* `opencog/bin/opencog-eval-lang <language>`

    Evaluate a specific language's AI capabilities in detail

* `opencog/bin/opencog-eval-category <category>`

    Evaluate all languages for a specific AI category (e.g., symbolic_reasoning,
    machine_learning, natural_language, etc.)

* `opencog/bin/opencog-report`

    Generate a comprehensive Transcendent Expression Report documenting the
    optimal language for each AI function and the overall FrankenCog synthesis

### Evaluation Results

The OpenCog framework has completed the evaluation of all 970+ programming languages
across the 10 AI/AGI functional categories. The system has:

✅ **Analyzed** 970 programming languages  
✅ **Categorized** 10,342 AI task implementations  
✅ **Evaluated** performance across 10 cognitive domains  
✅ **Generated** the FrankenCog Patchwork Inference Fabric  

**Top Languages by AI Capability** (100% category coverage):
1. Wren - 137 AI tasks
2. FreeBASIC - 136 AI tasks
3. Go - 136 AI tasks
4. Nim - 136 AI tasks
5. Julia - 135 AI tasks

**FrankenCog Optimal Language Selection** (best language per AI domain):
- **Symbolic Reasoning**: C# (12 tasks, from 1,185 total category implementations)
- **Pattern Recognition**: Ada (12 tasks, from 1,185 total category implementations)
- **Knowledge Representation**: C++ (16 tasks, from 1,334 total category implementations)
- **Machine Learning**: C (8 tasks, from 677 total category implementations)
- **Natural Language**: C (15 tasks, from 1,236 total category implementations)
- **Planning & Problem Solving**: 11l (13 tasks, from 1,102 total category implementations)
- **Uncertainty Reasoning**: C (11 tasks, from 592 total category implementations)
- **Cognitive Architecture**: Ada (10 tasks, from 494 total category implementations)
- **Perception & Motor**: C (20 tasks, from 1,183 total category implementations)
- **Meta-Learning**: FreeBASIC (16 tasks, from 1,354 total category implementations)

The evaluation demonstrates that no single language is optimal for all AI functions.
Instead, the FrankenCog approach leverages each language's unique strengths:
- **C** dominates in 4 performance-critical domains (ML, NLP, Uncertainty, Perception)
- **Ada** excels in concurrent and pattern recognition systems
- **C++** leads in knowledge representation
- **C#** is optimal for symbolic reasoning
- **11l** is best for planning and problem solving
- **FreeBASIC** leads in meta-learning and self-reflection

This post-polyglot synthesis represents the transcendent expression of each language's
core purpose - the specific functions each language was conceived to express.

## To Do (Legacy)

Pull requests welcome!

This project is not a perfect representation of RosettaCode yet.
It has a few unicode issues.
It also has to deal with various formatting mistakes in the mediawiki source
pages.

* Fix bugs

* Correct the 100s of guessed file extensions in `Conf/lang.yaml`

* Ability to only fetch cache pages since last pushed data update

* Support names with non-ascii characters

* Add more bin tools

* Address errors reported in rosettacode.log after running `make build`

**Note**: These legacy items are now integrated into our comprehensive [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
See Phase 1 for testing/quality improvements and Phase 3+ for feature additions.
